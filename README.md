# CoFonTest (horrible name i know) 
Got pissed off from wanting to test out fonts and needing to install each and every one of them, so I made this. Using vite as it's a simple project (Should have used tailwind aswell).

# TODOS: 

# COMPLETED TODOS: 
- Make font modal instead of dropdown 
- Make the font modal search bar fetch the fonts from google-fonts api
- Make the font modal show the top 15 most used fonts
- Remove background blur from font modal so that its easier to see the font changing in real time
- Add vim mode
- Add line numbers
